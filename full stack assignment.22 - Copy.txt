An array which is formed will be homogeneous. That is, in an integer array only integer values can be stored,
 while in a float array only floating value and character array can have only characters. Thus, no array can have values of two data types.
3.
There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences: NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation,
 unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.

Empty ()This function is used to create an array without initializing the entries of given shape and type.whereas,
zeros() and ones() are the NumPy library functions to create two different arrays. zeros() function is used to create an array based on the particular shape and type. 
All array elements are initialized to 0,which is created by the zeros() function. ones() function works like the zeros() function.
5.
umpy.fromfunction () function construct an array by executing a function over each coordinate and the resulting array, 
therefore, has a value fn (x, y, z) at coordinate (x, y, z). Syntax : numpy.fromfunction (function, shape, dtype) Parameters : function : [callable] 
The function is called with N parameters, where N is the rank of shape.
6.
It returns a numpy array of the same shape with values resulting from multiplying values in each array elementwise.
7.
his are combinations of functions, operands, and operators. These are used when you are manually calculating. An excel functions always begins with an equal (=) sign. 
The spread sheet is designed with functions and formulas that will make calculating numerical data easier and convenient .
8.
NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). 
Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original. 
The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory.
9.
It returns a numpy array of the same shape with values resulting from multiplying values in each array elementwise.
( As both the arrays need to have the same dimensions.)

 masked_where() function in which pass the condition for masking and array to be masked. ...
b.Using masked_where(), getmask() and masked_array() function: Pass the two array in the function as a parameter then use numpy. ma.
11.
The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean, 
i.e., std = sqrt(mean(x)) , where x = abs(a - a. mean())**2 . The average squared deviation is typically calculated as x. sum() / N , where N = len(x) .
12.
a = np.array([[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],[[7,8,9],[10,11,12]],[[13,14,15],[16,17,18]]])
a = np.expand_dims(a, axis=0)
a = np.repeat(a, 4, axis=0)
